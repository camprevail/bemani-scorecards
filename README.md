# bemani-scorecards
This repo is an example of a webhook service that can generate scorecard images from music-save network data from rhythm games.

Install the requirements.txt, don't upgrade pillow because newer versions messed with font rendering and deprecated some stuff.
<br>For museca, you'll need to drop your own music-info-b.xml into the assets folder, it won't be included in this repo.
