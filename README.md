# bemani-scorecards
This repo is an example of a webhook service that can generate scorecard images from music-save network data from rhythm games.
I host a live museca scorecard service with an improved version of this scorecard, so if you would like to get hooked up to that, 
open an issue and we'll get in touch.

Install the requirements.txt, don't upgrade pillow because newer versions messed with font rendering and deprecated some stuff.
<br>For museca, you'll need to drop your own music-info-b.xml into the assets folder, it won't be included in this repo.
